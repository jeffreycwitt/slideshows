# The University System

* The formation of the University of Paris was a bottom up enterprise
* As we've seen Paris included well established schools (Saint Victor's, St. Genevi√®ve's, and Notre Dame)
* These schools attracted all kinds of traveling scholars, hoping to study and teach, and hoping to find a place of security where this work could be done.
* Finding this security in the increasingly crowded city of Paris, you might imagine, grew increasingly difficult. 
* In order to provide this security, organization and bureacracy became necessary
