# Abelard Highlights

* b. 1079
* d. 1142
* Son of Knight
* Studied with Roscelin in the Loire valley region
* From 1102-1114 he studies, teaches, and struggles to find a place in the chaotic and politically charged world of Parisian higher education.
* In 1114 he receives the prestigious appointment as "Magister" at the Cathedral School of Notre Dame.
* From 1114-1117 he is the star academic of Paris
    - "ever neck craned and every eye strained to see him when he went out in public" (Baker, p. 74)
    - "students cam crowding to him from all over France and even from extremities of Europe" (Baker, p. 74)

# What Abelard Teaches Us

* Throughout the 12th century there was an unprecedented and an uncoordinated swell of teachers and students in urban centers with established cathedral and church schools.
 
* Abelard's own story of moving from one church to another, struggling to navigate the tricky and delicate political waters in order to find a post where he could make a living is a testimony to the fast moving, chaotic, and fluid nature of advanced education at Paris in the 12th century.

* As Richard Southern states: this was "short time, broadly corresponding to the first half of the twelfth century when there was a wide opportunity for individual enterprise and for ruthless competition, which was never again so uncontrolled" (see Baker, p. 75).

# Act 2: The University System

* The formation of the University of Paris was a bottom up enterprise.
 
* As we've seen, Paris included well-established schools (Saint Victor's, St. Geneviève's, and Notre Dame).
 
* These schools attracted all kinds of traveling scholars, hoping to study and teach, and hoping to find a place of security where this work could be done.
 
* Finding this security in the increasingly crowded city of Paris, you might imagine, grew increasingly difficult. 
 
* In order to provide this security, organization and bureaucracy became necessary.

* This process of unification and standardization was a unifying process. It was the process of forming a *UNIVERSITAS*.

# The Organization of Faculties

* The Lower Faculty (modern parallel: undergraduate studies at a liberal arts school)
    - The Faculty of Arts (mp: college of the arts and sciences)
        + Trivium (mp: the core or humanities)
            * Grammar
            * Logic
            * Rhetoric
        + Quadrivium (mp: your major that builds on the Core or the sciences)
            * Arithmetic
            * Geometry
            * Music
            * Astronomy
             
* The Superior Faculties (mp: grad school)
    - The Faculty of Medicine (Selerno)
    - The Faculty of Law (Canon Law) (Bologna)
    - The Faculty of Theology (Paris)

# Regulating teachers in the arts faculty

>No one is to lecture at Paris in arts before he is twenty years old. He is to listen in arts at least six years, before he begins to lecture. He is to promise that he will lecture for at least two years, unless he is prevented by some good reason, which be ought to prove either in public or before the examiners. He must not be smirched by any infamy. When he is ready to lecture, each one is to be examined according to the form contained in the letter of lord P. bishop of Paris (in which is contained the peace established between the chancellor and the students by the judges appointed by the lord pope, approved and confirmed namely by the bishop and deacon of Troyes and by P. the bishop, and J. the chancellor of Paris).

# Regulating teachers in the theology faculty

>We decide concerning the theologians, that no one shall lecture at Paris before he is thirty-five years old, and not unless he has studied at least eight years, [later prolonged to 14 years] and has heard the books faithfully and in the schools. He is to listen in theology for five years, be he reads his own lectures in public. No one of them is to lecture before the third hour on the days when the masters lecture.
